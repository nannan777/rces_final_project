## General Scope of the project
The dataset includes the data about soil properties and greenhouse gas fluxes of Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) wetland catchments. This project mainly focus on the characteristics of GHG like emission composition, emission concentration in this region. Aiming to analyze the exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, soil carbon sequestration or greenhouse gas flux.
## Dataset
['Soil properties and greenhouse gas fluxes of Prairie Pothole Region wetlands: a comprehensive data release' from USGS](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59a86e39e4b0421949a84627)
## Hypothesis
1.Is the GHG concentration releated to other parameters like soil saturation or temperature? If so, what is the relationship between them?
2. GHG gas fluexes have seasonal characteristics.
